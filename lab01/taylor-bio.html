            Hello, my name is Ella Taylor. I am a senior studying Applied Data Analytics and Policy Studies. I am interested in studying intelligence analysis and also working in technology consulting. I have programming skills in R, Python, and SQL. I also have taken many courses on data- specifically data visualization that I am very passionate about! Outside of work or classes I like to stay active by hiking with my friends, going for runs, and trying out new workout classes. I would say my favorite hobby is cooking or trying new foods. I like to experiment with recipes for dinner and enjoy making good food for my friends and family.
