                <li>ChatGPT was trained using Reinforcement Learning, human AI trainers provided conversations from both sides.</li>
                <li>Using this, data was collected in order to determine what responses are right vs. wrong.</li>

                <li>Often some answers are incorrect or nonsensical</li>
                <li>Sensitive to tweaks of input phrasing</li>
                <li>Overuses certain phrases</li>
                <li>Does not ask clarifying question but rather interprets meaning
