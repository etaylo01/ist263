    <h1>The Timeline of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <img src="../images/images.jpeg" alt="Computer and Human touching">
    <p>1950: Turning suggested that since humans can use information to solve problems, can’t computers too?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turning wrote Computing Machinery and Intelligence</li>
        </ul>
    <p>1956: Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hosted by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky</li>
        <li>“McCarthy, imagining a great collaborative effort, brought together top researchers from various fields for an open ended discussion on artificial intelligence, the term which he coined at the very event”

        </li>
        <li>Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI software program.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>1956-1974: AI flourishing </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before 1949, computers could not store information, but now computers were cheaper, faster, and could store information!</li>
        <li>Early demonstrations such as Newell and Simon’s General Problem Solver and Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA showed promise toward the goals of problem solving and the interpretation of spoken language respectively.

        </li>
        <li>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded AI research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>1980’s: Emergence of Deep Learning </p>
    <ul>
        <li>“John Hopfield and David Rumelhart popularized “deep learning” techniques which allowed computers to learn using experience”
            <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">Link</a>
        </li>
        <li>Neural Networks become widely used in AI applications

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>1982-1990: Investing in AI</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese Government invests “$400 million dollars with the goals of revolutionizing computer processing, implementing logic programming, and improving artificial intelligence.”

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>1997: Outsmarting Humans</p>
    <ul>
        <li>World chess champion and grand master Gary Kasparov was defeated by IBM’s Deep Blue, a chess computer program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>1995:Learning AI</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stuart Russell and Peter Novig publishes one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI: Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. They describe four potential goals or definitions of AI.</li>
        <li>“Human approach:
            <ul>
                <li>Systems that think like humans</li>
                <li>Systems that act like humans</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ideal approach:
            <ul>
                <li>Systems that think rationally</li>
                <li>Systems that act rationally”

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2015: AI and Images</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“Baidu's Minwa supercomputer uses a special kind of deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to identify and categorize images with a higher rate of accuracy than the average human”
            <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">Link</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2023: Rise in language models</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Programs such as ChatGPT created; causing enormous change in performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value.</li>
        <li>Continued development of deep-learning models</li>
