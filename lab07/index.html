            <p> This past summer, I worked for a management consulting firm in DC. I really enjoyed my time with the company, helping them develop their Data Analytics Service Team. <br> After graduation, I am hoping to go into tech consulting. I am also interested in studying intelligence analysis. </p>

            <p> Outside of work or classes I like to stay active by hiking with my friends, going for runs, and trying out new workout classes. I would say my favorite hobby is cooking or trying new foods. I like to experiment with recipes for dinner and enjoy making good food for my friends and family.</p>
