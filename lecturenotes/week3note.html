        <h2> Links</h2>
        <a href="http://google.com"> This is my link to google </a>
        <p>a is an inline tag, needs a break br because it doesnt creat space. YOU NEED TO INCLUDE HTTP <br>
            href is our attribute name and the url is the value </p>

        <h3>2 types of links </h3>

        internal links: link to internal links, you link to the file path within your laptop </p>
        
        <h3> Bookmark links</h3>
        <p> Bookmark links want to link to content lower down your page <br>
            2 parts: id place you are linking to and a pound sign that matches the id sign in the link
        </p>
